6 EARLIER(<column>, <number>) Returns the current value of the specified column in an outer evaluation pass of the mentioned column.
  6 <number can skip evaluation passes.  1 is the next evaluation level out.  Default is 1
  6 also EARLIEST
6 RELATED() to iterate the many side (and access the one side), RELATEDTABLE() to iterate the one side (and access the many side)
6 AVERAGEX() for moving averages; blanks are skipped! Can also use DIVIDE([total to use], [count of periods])
6 ADDCOLUMNS() to create return table with all of the columns of the table expression it iterates; SELECTCOLUMNS() to reduce # columns of a table
6 Trick: use CONCATENATEX to return a string of the selected dimensions: CONCATENATEX(VALUES([dimension]),[dimension],[delimiter],[dimension for order], [order direction])
6 RANKX() (1) lookup table iterated over first parameter, sorted lookup table of values (2) evaluate 2nd parameter in OG eval context (3) Position of value in 2nd step based on lookup table from 1st step.  Wrap in HASONEVALUE() to not show totals.  Use 1st and 3rd param for lookup table (1st) and value to rank (2nd). 4th param to set the order. 5th param to handle ties (DENSE, SKIP).  Use ALL() or ALLEXCEPT() for lookup table to ensure all are included either without filters or with them, depending on desired result
